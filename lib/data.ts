    summary: 'The classic map of Erangel has been remastered. Discover the new locations, strategies, and secrets to dominate the battlefield.',
    content: `>The iconic Erangel map has received a significant visual and tactical overhaul. Familiar locations now boast new structures, better cover, and enhanced graphical fidelity.

# Key Changes
- **Mylta Power, Quarry, and Prison:** These areas are now more complex, offering new opportunities for ambushes and strategic positioning.
- **Georgopol Crates:** Previously overlooked, this area now offers more verticality.

### Pro-Tips
1.  **Ledge Grab:** Remember to use the new ledge grab mechanic to access rooftops and unexpected vantage points. This can give you a significant advantage in the final circles.
2.  **Weapon Choice:** The M416 remains a versatile choice, but the Beryl M762 now packs an even bigger punch up close. Practice controlling its recoil in the training grounds to unlock its full potential.`,

    summary: 'Teamwork makes the dream work. Learn essential communication and positioning strategies to lead your squad to a chicken dinner.',
    content: `Winning in squad mode is less about individual skill and more about coordinated teamwork. The foundation of any successful squad is clear, concise communication.

### Roles & Communication
- **Establish Roles:** Before the match begins: a leader/shot-caller, a sniper/support, and two entry fraggers.
- **Use Markers:** Use the in-game markers religiously. Call out enemy positions using compass bearings ("Enemy at 285"), describe their equipment ("Level 3 helmet"), and state your intentions ("Pushing the blue house").

### Positioning
Avoid bunching up to minimize vulnerability to grenades and sprays. Maintain a perimeter, with each member covering a different angle. This "spread" allows you to gather more information and control a larger area.

> When engaging, focus fire on a single target to down them quickly. A 4v3 advantage is a massive game-changer.`,

    title: 'Weapon Analysis: The P90 Has Arrived',
    summary: 'The P90 SMG is now available in airdrops. Is it worth chasing? We break down its strengths and weaknesses.',
    content: `The latest addition to the airdrop-exclusive weapon pool is the P90 SMG. Chambered in 5.7mm, this weapon boasts a massive 50-round magazine and an incredibly high rate of fire.

**Strengths:**
- Its main strength is in close-quarters combat. The P90 can shred through opponents before they have a chance to react.
- The large magazine means you can take on multiple enemies without reloading.

**Weaknesses:**
- Significant damage drop-off at medium to long ranges.
- Its unique ammunition type means you can't restock from fallen enemies. You get what's in the crate, and that's it.

***

*Our verdict:* The P90 is a situational monster. If you're playing an aggressive, building-clearing style, it's one of the best weapons in the game. For players who prefer to fight from a distance, it might be better to stick with an AR.`,
